# shadcn registry manager - MCP Server

This project provides an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** for the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) component registry and CLI. It enables remote, programmatic, or containerized execution of shadcn CLI commands (such as `init`, `add`, etc.) that you would normally run locally, making it easy to automate, integrate, or run in cloud/dev environments. The MCP server can connect to both local and remote shadcn registries, providing a secure, extensible, and technical interface for automating project management tasks via AI or CLI agents.

## What It Does

This MCP server exposes shadcn CLI operations as MCP tools, so you (or an AI agent) can:

- Initialize a project
- Add components from the shadcn registry **including block components**
- List and fetch registry items
- Run all shadcn CLI workflows remotely
- Supports both the official shadcn registry - https://ui.shadcn.com/r and **custom/self-hosted registries** follow this guide: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/blocks

## Usage

### Docker

Run the MCP server in a container, mounting your project directory:

Add the following to your `mcp.json` file:

```json
   "shadcn-registry-manager": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--mount",
        "type=bind,src=<your-project-path>,dst=/workspace",
        "-e", 
        "REGISTRY_URL=https://ui.shadcn.com/r",
        "-e", 
        "STYLE=new-york",
        "reuvenaor/shadcn-registry-manager"
      ],
    },
```

#### Docker mounting explanation:

- **\<your-project-path\>** - Is the path to your project directory. 

  Example: `/Library/Projects/shadcn-registry-manager/www`

- **/workspace** - is the path to the workspace directory inside the container. 
(**Don't change it**, if you do, you must pass the same path as `cwd` param on every tool call)


#### Docker ENV Variables:
- **REGISTRY_URL**  
  - option 1: `https://ui.shadcn.com/r` - The URL of the shadcn registry
  - option 2: `http://localhost:3000>/r` - The URL of your own registry server (follow this guide: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/blocks)
- **STYLE** - is the style of the shadcn registry - `new-york`


### npx

You can also run the MCP server using npx, which is convenient for local development or CI/CD pipelines.

Add the following to your `mcp.json` file:

```json
  "shadcn-registry-manager": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "@reuvenorg/shadcn-registry-manager"
    ],
    "env": {
      "REGISTRY_URL": "https://ui.shadcn.com/r",
      "WORKSPACE_DIR": "/Library/Projects/mcp-docker/www",
      "STYLE": "new-york"
    }
  }
```

### Claude

You can also use the MCP server with Claude. Here are the configuration options:

#### Claude CLI Command:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope project shadcn-registry-manager npx @reuvenorg/shadcn-registry-manager -e REGISTRY_URL=https://ui.shadcn.com/r -e WORKSPACE_DIR=/Library/Projects/resume -e STYLE=new-york
```

#### Claude .mcp.json Configuration:

```json
{
  "shadcn-registry-manager": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "@reuvenorg/shadcn-registry-manager"
    ],
    "env": {
      "REGISTRY_URL": "https://ui.shadcn.com/r",
      "WORKSPACE_DIR": "/Library/Projects/resume",
      "STYLE": "new-york"
    }
  }
}
```

#### npx ENV Variables:

- **WORKSPACE_DIR** - The path to your project directory (mounted as the workspace)
- **REGISTRY_URL**  
  - option 1: `https://ui.shadcn.com/r` - The URL of the shadcn registry
  - option 2: `http://localhost:3000/r` - The URL of your own registry server (follow this guide: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/blocks)
- **STYLE** - is the style of the shadcn registry - `new-york`


## Example MCP Tools
- `get_init_instructions`: Get project initialization instructions
- `execute_init`: Run full project initialization
- `get_items`: List available registry items
- `get_item`: Fetch a specific registry item
- `add_item`: Add a registry item to your project
- `execute_add`: Add multiple components to your project
- `get_blocks`: Get current blocks from the registry


## Example Usage
